      <h1>🧩 Module 2.2: Modular Code</h1>
      <p>If you haven't realized by now, <strong>ORGANIZATION IS KEY</strong> when it comes to writing efficient code!</p>
      <p>As our bot's capabilities increase, our chatbot.py does too. This can sometimes lead to messy code which makes it tough to navigate and edit down the road.</p>

      <!-- Personality Section -->

        <h2>💭 What is Modularization?</h2>
        <p>You're probably wondering, <strong>"What the heck is mOdUlAriZaTiOn?"</strong></p>
        <p>Good news, we have an answer for you!</p>
        <p>Modularization is the process of <strong>breaking your code into smaller, organized, and reusable parts called functions or modules.</strong> Instead of one long script (like your current chatbot), you separate the logic into chunks with clear responsibilities. This makes your code easier to read, maintain, and extend.</p>
        <p>Some <strong>benefits</strong> of modularization include...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>📦 Easier to Understand</li>
          <li>🔧 Easier to Fix & Improve</li>
          <li>🧠 Easier to Reuse</li>
          <li>👨‍👩‍👧 Team-Friendly</li>
          <li>📈 Scalable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whether you realize it or not, those are some 🔥 benefits to the modularization process!</p>
        <p>So, to make this happen we'll categorize everything!</p>
        <p>🍴Think of it as putting dishes in the right cabinets after you take them out of the dishwasher...</p>
        <p>Plates have their own specific place, so do bowls, and so do glasses.</p>
        <p><strong>Each section of our code has its own specific place too!</strong> It becomes our job to make sure we 'put them away' correctly!</p>
        <h3>Here Are the Specific Places (or 'Cabinets') for each part of our chatbot.py 🤖</h3>
        <pre><code># ============================== Constants ==============================</code></pre>
        <pre><code># ============================== Utility Functions ======================</code></pre>
        <pre><code># ============================== Core Chat Functions ====================</pre></code>
        <pre><code># ============================== Main ===================================</code></pre>
        <p>Now that we know the correct <strong>'cabinets'</strong> our code should be placed in, it's time to put them away correctly!</p>
        <p>Below is an updated version of the code we've built to this point using modularization. Take a look and see if everything looks put away correctly...</p>
        <p><strong>Hint:</strong> Everything is put away correctly😉</p>

        <p>🎉 And there it is! You've officially used modularization to put your dishes (code) away. It's coming along great so far! <strong>Let's keep going!</strong></p>
      </section>

      <!-- Step 1: Create .json -->
      <h2>🚀 Pro Tip</h2>
      <p>You need to make sure you're continuing to save <strong>BOTH your chatbot.py AND learned_memory.json </strong></p>

      <!-- Step 2: Try It Out -->
      <h2>🤔 Why Modularization?</h2>
      <p>You might be thinking, <strong>"If the code functions the same as before, what's the point of categorizing everything?"</strong></p>
      <p>Think of your code as a map, and your bot as the driver of a car.</p>
      <p>If you handed your bot an empty map and expected it to find its own way to a destination, <strong>you'd be crazy!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Jumbled code is the equivalent of a blank map.</strong> Without efficent code, your bot cannot perform the tasks you programmed it to.</p>
      <p>Through the use of modularization, the map (A.K.A. Your Code) shows <strong>the perfect route to get your bot to the desired destination!</strong></p>

      <!-- More Personality Tips -->
      <section>
        <h2>🤝 Teamwork Makes the Dream Work</h2>
          <p>Another benefit to modularization is the idea that <strong>it allows for efficent collaboration!</strong></p>
          <p>When you make coding your professional career, <strong>you'll be put on assignments that require numerous developers at once.</strong></p>
          <p>The use of modularization will allow you and your collegues to seamlessly integrate changes and improvements without wondering, <strong>"Where the heck did they want me to adjust the bot's initial greetings?"</strong></p>
          <p>🗺️ Always remember the map!</p>
      </section>
      
      <h2>🚗 Ready to Move On?</h2>
      <p>With our dishes put away, we can really start to explore some cool functionalities that'll continue to make your bot unique!</p>
      <p>Go ahead and take a deep breath, <strong>you don't have a quiz just yet.</strong> We're going to keep plugging away on Chatbuddy's capabilities!</p>
