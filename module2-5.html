      <h1>🏋️‍♂️ Module 2.5: Extra Motivation</h1>
      <p>If you've made it this far, <strong>YOU'RE DOING AMAZING!🎉</strong></p>
      <p>We've implemented a TON of new updateds to Chatbuddy in this module, so for the last one, we're going to <strong>add some inspiration🏆</strong></p>

      <!-- Personality Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>😎 The Extra Motivation Feature</h2>
        <p>Chatbot development is not always the most seamless process. This being said, it never hurts to be given some words of wisdom from the one <strong>you're working the closest with...</strong>🤖 Chatbuddy itself!</p>
        <p>This update may seem easier than others in this module, and well, that's because <strong>you've done this before!</strong></p>
        <p>When prompted, we'll make sure Chatbuddy pulls motivational quotes from a random, rotating list...</p>
        <p>JUST like our current:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><pre><code>JOKES = [
    "Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts. 💀",
    "What do you call fake spaghetti? An impasta! 🍝",
    "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field! 🌾",
    "I'm reading a book on anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down! 📚",
    "Why did the math book look sad? Because it had too many problems. ➗"
]</code></pre></li>
<p>AND...</p>
          <li><pre><code>GREETINGS = ["Hey there! 👋", "Hiya! 😊", "Howdy! 🤠", "What's up? 🙌", "Yo yo yo! 🤖"]
MOOD_RESPONSES = [
    "I'm doing great, thanks for asking! 😎",
    "Better now that you're here! 😁",
    "Feeling fantastic! What about you? 🌟"
]</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>First, <strong>let's build our motivational quote list...🛠</strong></p>
        <p>To make sure we stay in line with our <strong>modular code</strong>, we'll naviagate here:</p>
        <pre><code># ============================== Constants ==============================</code></pre>
        <p>This is where we'll construct our <strong>random motivational quotes list</strong> where Chatbuddy will pull from when instructed to.</p>
        <p>For the sake of the exercise, we'll keep it to a list of <strong>5 random motivational quotes.</strong></p>
        <p>❗<strong>REMINDER:</strong> This is YOUR bot. Add or change the list of motivational quotes to fit what would provide YOU with the extra push to keep on going!</p>
        <pre><code>QUOTES = [
    "Believe in yourself and all that you are. 🌟",
    "You are capable of amazing things. 🚀",
    "Every day is a second chance. 🌅",
    "Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you. 💪",
    "Success doesn’t come from what you do occasionally, it comes from consistency.🏆"
]</code></pre>
        <p>With our random list of motivational quotes now in place, let's <strong>craft the elif statement:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>    elif "inspire me" in user_input or "motivate me" in user_input:
        print(f"ChatBuddy: 💡 {random.choice(QUOTES)}")</code></pre>
        <p>And let's not forget to <strong>update our 'Help Feature'</strong> as well...</p>
        <pre><code>🔹 Ask for motivation: "inspire me", "motivate me"</code></pre>
        <p>Now that we know what needs to be done, let's go ahead and <strong>FULLY update our chatbot.py 💬</strong></p>
        <p>❗<strong>REMINDER:</strong> If your chatbot.py looks slightly different, that <strong>OKAY</strong>. Your bot is <strong>supposed to be unique!</strong></p>

        <p>❗<strong>REMINDER:</strong> Your code will NOT run its most up-to-date version UNLESS you save your file prior to running it!</p>
      <p>Let's get motivated! Boot up your newly <strong>SAVED</strong> chatbot.py </p>
      <p>Following the <strong>introduction phase</strong>, input either:</p>
      <pre><code>motivate me</code></pre>
      <p>OR</p>
      <pre><code>inspire me</code></pre>
      <p>Similar to the <strong>JOKE & GREETINGS</strong> features, Chatbuddy will pull a motivational quote from your generated list!</p>
      <p>You should receive an output including one of the quotes from the quote list such as:</p>
      <pre><code>ChatBuddy: 💡 Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you. 💪</code></pre>
      <p>And there you have it! When prompted, Chatbuddy will now give you your <strong>daily dose of motivation!🚀</strong></p>

      <!-- Step 2: Try It Out -->
      <h2>🌀 Module 2 Comes to a Close...</h2>
      <p><strong>YOU DID IT!</strong></p>
      <p>With this lesson in the rearview, <strong>Module 2 is OVER!🎉</strong></p>
      <p>You've upgraded your Chatbuddy in more ways that one and <strong>it looks AWESOME!</strong></p>
      <p>We can't wait to show you what we have in store in <strong>Module 3!💪</strong></p>

      <h2>🍎 Here's the Plan...</h2>
      <p>As usual, we'll run you through a quick <strong>overview</strong> of everything you learned in Module 2!</p>
      <p>Then, in order to <strong>unlock Module 3</strong>, you'll need to pass the <strong>Module 2 Assessment</strong>.</p>
      <p>Don't freak out just yet. Module 2's Assessment is the <strong>same format as the Module 1 Assessment.</strong> It just holds questions pertaining to Module 2 (obviously).</p>
      <p>Before we move on, <strong>give your 👀 a break from the computer screen</strong> & go outside to get some fresh air!</p>
      <p><strong>See You Soon!</strong></p>
