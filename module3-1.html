        <p>Now that we're all caught up, let's <strong>OFFICIALLY</strong> begin Module 3!🎉</p>
        <h2>🥶 Improving the User-Experience</h2>
        <p>You might be thinking, <strong>"Why do these people keep stressing the importance of uSeR-eXpErIenCe?"</strong> Well, it's actually pretty simple...</p>
        <p>We have established your <strong>goal of making 💲</strong> and <strong>landing a developer role.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A POSITIVE USER-EXPERIENCE IS THE 🔑 TO WEALTH.</strong></p>
        <p>To make money, you need to <strong>move your client's money to YOUR pockets...</strong></p>
        <p>If your clients are enjoying the programs you have developed, their 💲 will be fast-tracked to <strong>YOUR</strong> pockets as they will always want more.</p>
        <p><strong>IN SUMMARY:</strong> Improved UX = More 💲</p>
      <!-- Step 2: Try It Out -->
      <h2>⚾ Here's the Game-Plan...</h2>
      <p>Right away, we're going to come out swinging for the fences.</p>
      <p>To start our journey in the world of UX, we're going to make Chatbuddy multi-user capable.</p>
      <p>If you've been showing off your Chatbuddy to your family & friends, odds are everyone has interacted with it under the same<strong> 'account.'</strong></p>
      <p>By <strong>'account,'</strong> we mean that everything your bot has learned to this point has been stored in the same memory file:</p>
      <pre><code>leanred_memory.json</code></pre>
      <p>What we're getting at is, if you and your brother, <strong>Jeff</strong>, are taking turns using the bot, odds are your preferences will not always align...</p>
      <h3>🫂 Here's an Example</h3>
      <p>Your brother, <strong>Jeff</strong>, is interacting with Chatbuddy. Jeff's favroite baseball team is the <strong>Boston Red Sox.</strong></p>
      <p>So Jeff has programmed Chatbuddy's memory like this...</p>
      <pre><code>Jeff: What's my favorite baseball team?
ChatBuddy: Your favorite baseball team is the Boston Red Sox! Their last World Series ring came in 2018! Let's get another this year!⚾</code></pre>
    <p>Now, Jeff heads to work and it is <strong>your turn</strong> to interact with Chatbuddy.</p>
    <p>You <strong>HATE</strong> the Red Sox. You've been a diehard fan of the <strong>New York Yankees</strong> for as long as you can remember.</p>
    <p>So, as a Yankees fan, you're going to be a bit dissapointed when <strong>YOU</strong> ask:</p>
    <pre><code>You: What's my favorite baseball team?</code></pre>
    <p>And Chatbuddy responds with:</p>
    <pre><code>ChatBuddy: Your favorite baseball team is the Boston Red Sox! Their last World Series ring came in 2018! Let's get another this year!⚾</code></pre>
    <p>Now, becasue they are <strong>different inputs</strong>, Chatbuddy will respond with whatever is logged in it's memory file.</p>
    <p>❗ Chatbuddy has <strong>NO IDEA WHO IS USING THE PROGRAM</strong>. After you introduce yourself, <strong>Chatbuddy assumes you are the user for the duration it is booted up.</strong></p>
    <p>This kind of confusion will likely cause some tension between you and Jeff.</p>
    <p>So, wouldn't it be cool to <strong>create individual user-profiles with their own individual memory files</strong> so that everyone can have their own <strong>profile?</strong></p>
    <p>Well, that's <strong>EXACTLY</strong> what we're going to do!</p>

      <h2>📺 Stay Tuned...</h2>
      <p>That was <strong>A LOT</strong> of bark & not much bite...</p>
      <p>But now that we have laid out the game-plan, as well as <strong>WHY</strong> we should implement individual user-profiles, let's get to it!</p>
      <p>We told you it was going to get good...</p>
      <p>Before we REALLY get into it, <strong>grab some water or coffee & something to eat.</strong> Your 🧠 can't function without fuel!</p>
      <p><strong>Let's Do It!</strong></p>
