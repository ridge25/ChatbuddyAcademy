        <p>Before we dive back into our bot development, let's make sure we're all on the same page. A few 🔑 features from the last module include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>🤝 Formal Introductions</li>
          <li>👋 Random Greetings</li>
          <li>📅 Date & Time Functionality</li>
          <li>🧠 Temporary Memory Capabilities</li>
          <li>🎭 Emotional Detection</li>
          <li>😂 Random Jokes if the User is Sad</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Just so we're on the same page, here is the code that we'll be beginning this module with...</p>
        <p>(If yours is slightly different due to some custom additions <strong>that's great!</strong> Just make sure you're keeping up with the foundational updates too!)</p>

        <p>As we mentioned, at this point in the course your <strong>chatbot.py</strong> should mirror or at least look similar to the code above⬆️</p>
        <p>Now you're probably wondering, <strong>"Where will we go from here?"</strong> or <strong>"How can we make our bot smarter?"</strong>...</p>
        <p>Well, this is the point of the course where <strong>it's about to get good.</strong></p>
      </section>

      <!-- Add Memory Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>🧠 Learning Mode: Activated</h2>
        <p>Right now, if the bot is faced with a word or phrase it is unsure of it will respond with something like:</p>
        <pre><code>"ChatBuddy: Hmm... I don't know how to respond to that yet."</code></pre>
        <p>Now, since you're becoming a development professional, let's <strong>integrate the ability to have your bot expand its knowledge base as the interaction continues!</strong></p>
      </section>

      <!-- Step 1: Create .json -->
      <h2>🚧 Step 1: Create a .json file</h2>
      <p>You might be wondering "What on 🌍 is a .json file?</p>
      <p>A .json file is a <strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong> format used specifically to both <strong>store</strong> & <strong>transmit</strong> data.</p>
      <p>So let's go ahead and get rolling!</p>
      <p><strong>1.</strong> Right click on your project folder and select 'New File'</p>
      <p><strong>2.</strong> Name the file <strong>learned_memory.json </strong></p>
      <p><strong>3.</strong> In the very first line of code, type:</p>
      <pre><code>{}</code></pre>
      <p><strong>4.</strong> Now, make sure to <strong>save the file</strong></p>

      <!-- Step 2: Try It Out -->
      <h2>🤿  Step 2: Dive Back In </h2>
      <p>Now it's time to adjust our chatbot.py so we can <strong>activate learning mode</strong>!</p>
      <p>Here are <strong>3</strong> integrations we'll consider...</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>import json</code></li>
        <p>Your new json file will now be linked to your chatbot.py, and when called upon will provide the applicable response!</p>
        <li><code># Load learned memory
learned_memory_file = "learned_memory.json"
if os.path.exists(learned_memory_file):
    with open(learned_memory_file, "r") as f:
        learned_memory = json.load(f)
else:
    learned_memory = {}</code></li>
        <p>The <strong># Load Learned Memory</strong> will prompt your bot to refer to your json file that will continously expand as your bot learns more!</p>
        <li><code># LEARNING MODE
print("ChatBuddy: I don't know how to respond to that yet. 🤔")
print("ChatBuddy: What should I say next time someone says that?")
new_response = input(f"{user_name}: ")
learned_memory[user_input] = new_response

# Save to file
with open(learned_memory_file, "w") as f:
    json.dump(learned_memory, f, indent=4)

print("ChatBuddy: Got it! I'll remember that next time. 🧠")</code></li>
        <p>This is the magic recipe that turns on your bot's brain!</p>
      </ul>

      <!-- More Personality Tips -->
      <section>
        <h2>🚀 Pro Tip</h2>
          <p>A gentle reminder to <strong>SAVE, SAVE, SAVE!</strong> Copy & Paste your code into an external sheet (Google Docs, Word, etc...). If something goes wrong and your system crashes, your code is at risk of being deleted. Take the extra step to make sure your code is securely stored elsewhere!</p>

      <h2>📝 Try It For Yourself</h2>
      <p>Now that the json file & the chatbot.py file are updated, go ahead and start your bot up as usual!</p>
      <p>Test the implementation by first going through the introduction phase <strong>(i.e. "What's your name?" & "How are you?")</strong></p>
      <p>Next, type something that the bot shouldn't recognize. Let's do something like this:</p>
      <pre><code>I like turtles</code></pre>
      <p>Your bot should then respond with something like:</p>
      <pre><code>ChatBuddy: I don't know how to respond to that yet. 🤔
ChatBuddy: What should I say next time someone says that?</code></pre>
<p>Now, it's completely up to you as to what you want the response to be! For the sake of the exercise, let's say you go with something like:</p>
<pre><code>That’s cool! Turtles are awesome! 🐢</code></pre>
<p>After you tell the bot how it should respond, it should say:</p>
<pre><code>ChatBuddy: Got it! I'll remember that next time. 🧠</code></pre>
<p>Now go ahead and type in the same phrase as before. In this case:</p>
<pre><code>I like turtles</code></pre>
<p>And would you look at that! <strong>Your bot remembers!</strong></p>
<p>If you go check your <strong>json</strong> file, you should now see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "i like turtles": "That's cool! Turtles are awesome! 🐢"
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, even if you end the conversation and <strong>restart the terminal</strong>, your bot will still remember the response you wanted!</p>
<p>🌟 If you ever want to change the response given or erase a certain memory (AKA perform bot brain surgery), all you have to do is <strong>head into your json file</strong> and adjust accordingly!</p>
