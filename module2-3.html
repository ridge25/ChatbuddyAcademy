      <h1>🆘 Module 2.3: The Help Button</h1>
      <p>As the list of Chatbuddy's capabilities continues to grow, it becomes a good idea to give potential users <strong>some sense of direction</strong> when they interact with the bot.</p>
      <p>We talked about providing Chatbuddy with a <strong>map for making well-informed decisions</strong>, and it is equally as important to make sure your user(s) have some sense of direction as well!</p>

      <!-- Personality Section -->

        <h2>🔧 Why a Help Button is... Helpful</h2>
        <p>The implementation might not seem like the most exciting implementation so far, but <strong>let us sway your thinking...</strong></p>
        <p>Implementing a 'Help Button' is the first step in truly making your bot <strong>user-friendly</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you think about it, everything we have coded up to this point has been strictly for <strong>your enjoyment</strong>. This isn't a bad thing by any means, but if your plan is to deploy your bot or let your friends interact with it at some point, <strong>you need to provide some sense of direction if it's requested!</strong></p>
        <p>🤔 Still not totally sure? Here are some benefits of throwing in that good 'ole SOS...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>🔍 Improves User Guidance</li>
          <li>🧭 Reduces Confusion</li>
          <li>⚡ Boosts Efficiency</li>
          <li>💬 Encourages Engagement</li>
          <li>🎯 Supports User Satisfaction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here's the thing. We know that at some point during your development journey, you've probably thought, <strong>"I feel like bot development could be a good way to make some decent money..."</strong></p>
        <p>And in this case... <strong>YOU'RE RIGHT</strong>🤑</p>
        <p>The thing is, <strong>the more user-friendly your bot is, the more money there is to get!</strong>🍊</p>
        <p>Selling a bot with capabilities that only you understand <strong>is pointless</strong>.</p>
        <p>But, selling a bot where its capabilities are outlined specifically so the user knows how to interact with it <strong>is priceless</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Remember, we just worked hard on modularization! It's important to make sure we keep that ball rolling! We'll throw our new 'Help' button information in the:</h3>
        <pre><code># ============================== Constants ==============================</code></pre>
        <p>Now that we know where the 'Help' button information will go, let's go ahead and update your <strong>chatbot.py </strong>in FULL!🌟</p>
        <p>Here is the <strong>Help Button</strong> feature built directly into your existing code!</p>

        <p>Now your 🆘 button has been <strong>fully implemented!</strong> Here's how you can test it for yourself...</p>
        <p>First, <strong>start up your bot as usual</strong> and <strong>go through the introduction process</strong> (to be polite of course).</p>
        <p>Next, type in</p>
        <pre><code>help</code></pre>
        <p>After inputting the <strong>'Help'</strong> message, Chatbuddy should display the response we coded:</p>
        <pre><code>Here are some things you can ask me! 🤖💬
            
🔹 Greet me: "hi", "hello", "hey"
🔹 Ask how I'm doing: "how are you?"
🔹 Ask the time: "what time is it?", "current time"
🔹 Ask the date: "what's the date?", "current date"
🔹 Tell me your favorites:
    - "my favorite color is blue"
    - "what's my favorite color?"
    - "my favorite food is pizza"
    - "what's my favorite food?"
    - "my nickname is champ"
    - "what's my nickname?"
🔹 Tell me how you're feeling (e.g., tired, sad, great)
🔹 Teach me new responses! If I don’t know something, you can tell me how to reply.
🔹 Say "bye" to end the chat

<p>Now, your user has the ability to see just how much Chatbuddy is truly capable of!</p>
<p><strong>If for some reason your bot doesn't display the help menu, please make sure your code matches ours!</strong></p>
<p>🤠 A Quick Hint: If you decide to add more to your bot beyond what we're teaching (Which is super great & we encourage), <strong>make sure you update your 'Help' menu with the most up-to-date capabilities</strong> your bot has!</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Step 1: Create .json -->
      <h2>🚀 Pro Tip</h2>
      <p>Ask for feedback! The easiest way to see if your users are satisfied with your bot is by asking a friend to <strong>test-drive</strong> it before deploying it!</p>

      <!-- Step 2: Try It Out -->
      <h2>🌐 What's Next?</h2>
      <p>Now that we've given the user the ability to <strong>see what Chatbuddy is capable of</strong>, let's keep seeing how far we can push it!</p>
      <p>Before we learn more, we do have a <strong>quick quiz</strong> you need to take in order to unlock the next lesson...🔓</p>
      <p>As the usual mid-module quizzes go, it'll be <strong>5 multiple choice questions.</strong> Just a reminder, you need to get <strong>at least FOUR correct in order to pass.</strong></p>
      <p>Feeling confident? <strong>Let's do it!</strong></p>
